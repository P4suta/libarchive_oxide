# Campaign 3 completion evidence

This snapshot records the technical evidence for the interoperability-evidence
slices of RM-300, beginning with RM-301: a reusable interoperability-evidence
harness that later format slices (ZIP, 7z, tar, cpio, ar, ISO, CAB, XAR) all sit
on, plus a producer-corpus provenance policy. RM-301 adds no new archive method
and no `src/` runtime change; it proves the machinery on already-supported
formats by reading each independent producer's output back through arca and
requiring identical normalized shapes and contents, and by handing arca's own
writer output to independent consumers that must reconstruct the same content.
The harness carries heterogeneous producers and consumers as bare `fn` pointers
inside concrete non-generic case structs, so RM-302/303/304 add cases by writing
a free function and a `&[]` array without editing the harness. RM-301 is based on
its working tree. The parent epic closes only after every slice has passed its
required remote checks and reached `main`.

No tag, package publication, GitHub Release, release-workflow execution, version
change, or versioned release candidate is part of this snapshot.

## RM-301

- ADR-0011 specifies the interoperability-evidence harness: a normalized
  `EntryShape` capturing the raw path bytes, kind, full uncompressed content, and
  (where a source exposes it) compression method, so shapes from different
  producers compare for equality of content rather than merely count. Equality is
  a field-subset projection over `(path, kind, content)`; the optional method and
  the derived size are excluded, so a Store producer and a Deflate producer of the
  same logical entry set still compare equal. The sole constructor `EntryShape::new`
  centralizes dir-slash normalization (one trailing `b'/'` stripped when the kind
  is a directory), so arca's directory path `b"sub"` and a spec-conformant raw
  `b"sub/"` read back as the same canonical shape. Paths are `Vec<u8>`/`&[u8]`
  end to end; `String` never appears, so non-UTF-8 names survive losslessly.
- `read_with_arca` reads any arca-readable bytes through `SeekArchiveReader`,
  accumulating every `Data` chunk into the shape's content so equality checks are
  real, never count-only; its `ReaderEvent` match handles the entry, data,
  metadata, and end variants and returns on `Done`, with a wildcard arm guarding
  the `#[non_exhaustive]` enum's future variants.
  `assert_producers_agree` feeds the same logical entry set to each producer and
  requires every read-back to equal the canonical shapes derived from that set
  (the single source of truth), so a bug shared by all producers cannot pass —
  this is the "≥3 producers can be read" evidence, applied repeatedly.
  `assert_consumers_accept` hands arca's writer output to each independent consumer
  and requires each to reconstruct the same content — the "≥2 consumers accept"
  evidence. Both take arbitrary N and M as slices, so RM-302/303/304 pass their
  own producer/consumer arrays unchanged.
- The demo binary proves the machinery on already-supported formats. ZIP Store and
  ZIP Deflate are each proven with three independent producers (arca's ZIP writer,
  the `zip` crate's `ZipWriter`, and a first-party hand-built raw-ZIP builder) and
  two independent consumers (arca via `read_with_arca` and the `zip` crate via
  `zip_crate_decode`), with method evidence asserted through `assert_method` where
  the ZIP consumer exposes `.compression()`. The entry set exercises a file, a
  directory, and a file in a subdirectory to hit the dir-slash normalization path.
  Under the `sevenz` feature, 7z LZMA2 is proven with two producers (arca's
  `SeekArchiveWriter` and `sevenz-rust2`) and two consumers (arca and
  `sevenz-rust2` via `sevenz_rust2_decode`).
- Provenance is deterministic in-code generation from the pinned
  `[dev-dependencies]`: no binaries are committed for ZIP or 7z this slice, every
  producer and consumer records its identity as `crate@version` taken verbatim
  from the Cargo pins (`zip@8.6.0`, `sevenz-rust2@0.21.3`) and embedded in the
  case name, so any interop failure names the exact producer and version that
  disagreed. Per-format registries
  `libarchive_oxide/tests/fixtures/zip/PROVENANCE.md` and
  `libarchive_oxide/tests/fixtures/sevenz/PROVENANCE.md` record the
  producers and consumers, the generation policy, the reserved external-tool
  corpus layout, and a "how to extend" guide for RM-302/303/304. The harness adds
  no trait object, no closure, no generic parameter, and no new runtime
  dependency, and the crate keeps `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.

## Reproduced gates

- Working tree, Windows x86_64, portable codec profile with `--features sevenz,aes`:
  `cargo test -p libarchive_oxide --features sevenz,aes --test interop_foundation`
  passed 3/3 (`zip_store_interop`, `zip_deflate_interop`, `sevenz_lzma2_interop`).
  Without the `sevenz` feature the 7z case is `#[cfg]`-gated out and 2/2 remain.
- `cargo test -p libarchive_oxide --features sevenz,aes --test sevenz_differential`
  passed 4/4 after the differential tests were routed through the shared harness
  (test count unchanged from `main`).
- The full `cargo test -p libarchive_oxide --features sevenz,aes` suite passed
  (0 failed), including the new `interop_foundation` demo alongside the existing
  engine, codec, zip, 7z, OCI, and package suites.
- `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo clippy -p libarchive_oxide --tests --features sevenz,aes -- -D warnings`,
  the `no-dyn` gate (heterogeneous producers/consumers are bare `fn` pointers, not
  trait objects), and
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc -p libarchive_oxide --no-deps --features sevenz,aes`
  all pass; the crate keeps `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` (`src/lib.rs`) with no new
  runtime dependency (`Cargo.toml` unchanged).

## Out of scope for this slice

RM-301 adds no new archive method: it proves the harness on already-supported
formats (ZIP Store/Deflate and 7z LZMA2) only. Extending interop evidence to new
ZIP and 7z methods — and to the remaining formats (tar, cpio, ar, ISO, CAB, XAR)
with three producers and two consumers per method — is RM-302, RM-303, RM-304,
and their successors, each of which adds free producer/consumer functions and a
`&[]` array without editing the harness. Byte-exact external-tool artifacts,
their `tests/fixtures/<format>/<producer>/` corpus rows, and the regeneration
provenance blocks are created only when a future slice needs them. Remote checks
and reaching `main` remain required before the RM-300 epic can close.
